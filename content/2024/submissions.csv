Wu",Developing a Data Dashboard to Support Student Success in a Medical Sciences Baccalaureate Program,"Pre-medical students face the challenge of managing rigorous academic and extracurricular demands, which can lead to burnout. Effective tracking and visualization of their activities are crucial in keeping records of student progress. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a user-friendly dashboard tailored for pre-medical student data management. Semi-structured interviews with nine MSBP faculty members identified major issues in current data management practices, including standardization and tracking. Using affinity diagramming and Miroboard, five key themes emerged, guiding the creation of an initial dashboard prototype. After iterative critiques and revisions, the final design received positive feedback from the MSBP committee. Limitations include a small sample size and lack of formal usability testing. Future work will focus on addressing implementation challenges and refining the design based on user feedback.",2024-11-09,The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)

6,Poster,"Bin Choi, Brian Ondov, Huan He and Hua Xu",Towards Enhanced Topic Discovery on Semantic Maps for Biomedical Literature Exploration,"The rapid growth of biomedical research has led to an overwhelming volume of literature, making it challenging for researchers to efficiently explore and analyze. While existing tools provide an overview of semantic maps and publication distributions, further refinement is needed to reveal fine-grained nuances and hierarchical topics. To address this, we propose a novel method for hierarchical topic modeling and label generation on 2D semantic maps. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we apply density-based hierarchical clustering using HDBSCAN to construct a topic tree. Second, we employ a novel tree-based TF-IDF method to refine topic representation using MeSH terms, capturing both general and local topic distinctions. Finally, we optimize label positioning using a centroid-based method to enhance visualization.",2024-11-09,The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)

11,Paper,"Karan Jogi, Stephanie Greenwald, Marco Colombo, Sarah Owens and Rigel Gjomemo","VISTA: Variant Insights, Surveillance and Tracking Analytics, a Visualization Platform for Public Health","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic gave rise to multiple data analytics and visualizations related to the spread of the virus and community health. Among these, visualizations aiming to track SARSCoV-2 variants diffusion among the population help public health officials determine interventions and policies to counter the spread of variants of interest. Existing visualizations for variant diffusion are usually static and produced in a rigid workflow. In this paper, we present a new dashboard for the visualization of SARS-CoV-2 variants diffusion across the population. The dashboard, named VISTA, combines multiple datasets in an easy-to-use and intuitive interface that allows to visually perform numerous tasks, including correlation among regions, comparisons, and characterizations of variants with features of interest to public health officials",2024-11-09,The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)

Hassan Murad, Huan He and Irbaz Bin Riaz",Visual Explanation of the Assessment of Certainty of Evidence for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Practitioners of evidence-based medicine need to know the level of certainty in the evidence they are applying to patient care. We use a living interactive evidence synthesis framework to create and maintain living, interactive systematic reviews (LISRs). With each new update, it is critical to report any changes to the confidence level or certainty of synthesized evidence (CoE) for patient important endpoints. Ascertaining CoE is a complex task and thus challenging in the setting of LISRs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid approach, which leverages an interactive web-based visualization techniques to accelerate the CoE evaluation.",2024-11-09,The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)
16,Poster,"Syed Arsalan Ahmed Naqvi, Kunwer Sufyan Faisal, Manal Imran, Muhammad Ali Khan, Kaneez Zahra Rubab Khakwani, M. Hassan Murad, Huan He and Irbaz Bin Riaz",A Patient Decision Aid Tool to Support Shared Decision-Making,"Patient decision aid (PDA) is a tool designed to help individuals make informed choices about their treatment plan in a shared decision-making setting. Multiple treatment options are usually available, and thus the benefits, harms, and practical considerations of each option should be considered before making a decision. These tools can summarize available treatment options for a particular condition, along with their benefits and harms. Several such tools are commonly used in practice such as OptionGrid and Mayo Diabetes cards.However, the timeliness of the information provided by the PDA tools may not always be up-to-date, especially if the evidence base for a particular treatment option is evolving rapidly. The printed decision aids may not be able to keep up with changes in treatment guidelines or recommendations. Additionally, some decision aids can be complex or overwhelming, which may make it difficult for patients to understand and use them effectively. Patients may need additional support or guidance to use decision aids effectively. To address these challenges, we proposed a framework to create a PDA tool based on a living systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) platform using advanced interactive web-based data visualization techniques.",2024-11-09,The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)
