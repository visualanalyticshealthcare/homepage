CALL FOR PAPERS
============================================

Full-day Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC)
(In conjunction with IEEE VIS 2025)

The 2025 Workshop on Visual Analytics (VA) in Healthcare (VAHC 2025) is the 16th annual workshop that provides an opportunity for participants to discuss state-of-the-art interactive visual data analysis techniques and review how such techniques can be applied to healthcare data. Moreover, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), generative AI, and other emerging technologies have led to a growing and evolving need in healthcare VA. These technologies can be leveraged to enhance AI explainability and improve human data analysis through AI-driven reasoning. The primary objective of the workshop is to bring together leading VIS designers, VA researchers, medical experts, and visionaries to discuss: a) interactive data visualization techniques that can be applied to healthcare data, b) areas of healthcare that need more attention from visualization and visual data analysis, and c) emerging research trends, visualization techniques, software applications, benchmarks, and open datasets. The workshop will enable presenters to showcase their ongoing work through oral presentation and system demonstrations. In past years, both demonstrations of prototype and production visual analytics software have been particularly well received, and paper submitters are encouraged to submit a companion demo proposal.

TOPICS AND SCOPE:
------------------
We welcome discussions on the use of VA approaches, interaction design, statistical methods, AI, explainable AI, and ML applied to healthcare data analysis. Participants may address the needs of various user groups, including (but not limited to) patients, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, public health analysts, physicians, hospital-based quality assurance officers, and insurance claim analysts.

The 2025 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare will cover a range of topics on the design, implementation, deployment, evaluation, and abstraction of VA methods, including (but not limited to):
- Applications of visual analytics to:
    - Clinical care
    - Multi-omic datasets
    - Patient-generated health data
    - Digital and mobile health, and digital twins
- Patient- and consumer-related methods:
    - Understanding of patient/health consumer behavior and experience
    - Personalized healthcare and health management
    - Patient education, empowerment, and quality of life
    - Clinician-patient communication
- VA-machine intelligence for healthcare data visualization
    - Human-centered AI for health decision-making
    - Human-AI collaboration and modern mixed initiatives
    - Equitable and ethical AI for healthcare analytics
    - Explainable and interpretable AI
    - Large-language model workflow integrations
- Public health data
    - Epidemiology and disease surveillance
    - Health behavior and lifestyle studies
    - Health systems and policy evaluation
    - Longitudinal and genetic studies
    - Global health inequality and development tracking

IDENTIFYING GRAND CHALLENGES
---------------------------------------
After 15 years of VAHC workshops at both IEEE VIS and American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), several special journal issues, the founding of a formal VIS Working Group within the AMIA, and a substantial collection of  papers, VAHC has helped lead the way toward advancing the use of visualization and VA within health domains. Yet, over the same time period, many forces have emerged to transform the health informatics ecosystem: a worldwide pandemic, the proliferation of mobile devices and sensors, the emergence of AI, and the rise of large population electronic health data resources, to name a few. At VAHC 2025, we will include a Grand Challenges session where we will work to integrate the expertise of present and past authors, panelists, audience, and committees to shape a common set of grand challenges for this field, in this era. To support this, we introduce a separate track for short position papers. We aim to collaboratively publish a Grand Challenges article using workshop outcomes to help guide future research.

PAPER SUBMISSION AND FORMAT GUIDELINES:
---------------------------------------

We will accept short papers with up to six pages plus one page of references (6+1). 

We encourage a diverse range of submissions and demonstrations from academia, healthcare organizations, and industry in any of the short paper types listed below: 
- Application/Research papers (format: “6+1”)
- System Demonstration papers (format “2+1”)
- Posters (format: “2+1” extended abstract and A0 poster) 
- (**NEW FOR THIS YEAR**) Grand Challenge (position) paper(format “2+1”)

All accepted types of submissions will have the chance for an oral presentation.

Demonstrations: Every system demonstration paper may be accompanied by a video submission.

All material will be submitted via the Precision Conference System (PCS), and a link will be announced at a later date.

For all submissions, please use the VGTC conference style template:

Contact vahc.sig at gmail.com if you have any questions for the chairs, while contact vahc.paperschairs at gmail.com to get in touch with the paper chairs for any questions about the submission process.

BEST PAPERS:
----------------
VAHC assigns Best Paper and Honorable Mention awards, expressed by certificates and recognition on the VAHC workshop website. We plan to invite authors of high-quality papers to submit a revised and extended version to an internationally recognized scientific journal. More details will be disclosed in the next weeks, as the submission deadline approaches.
