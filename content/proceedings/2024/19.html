<h2>The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)</h2>
<h3>From Data to Narrative: An Intuitive Software Solution for Statistical Process Control Chart Creation, Exploration, and Storytelling</h3>

<p>Abstract: Healthcare Quality Improvement (QI) frequently employs Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts, but current tools are cumbersome, requiring extensive expertise and manual data manipulation. Our SPC ChartR software streamlines SPC chart generation, enabling intuitive exploration and contextual storytelling. This system offers an innovative solution for both experienced QI professionals and clinicians with limited data literacy, and it enhances data visualization efficiency as validated by substantial task completion rate improvements and a high System Usability Scale score.</p>
