<h2>The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)</h2>
<h3>VISTA: Variant Insights, Surveillance and Tracking Analytics, a Visualization Platform for Public Health</h3>

<p>Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic gave rise to multiple data analytics and visualizations related to the spread of the virus and community health. Among these, visualizations aiming to track SARSCoV-2 variants diffusion among the population help public health officials determine interventions and policies to counter the spread of variants of interest. Existing visualizations for variant diffusion are usually static and produced in a rigid workflow. In this paper, we present a new dashboard for the visualization of SARS-CoV-2 variants diffusion across the population. The dashboard, named VISTA, combines multiple datasets in an easy-to-use and intuitive interface that allows to visually perform numerous tasks, including correlation among regions, comparisons, and characterizations of variants with features of interest to public health officials</p>
