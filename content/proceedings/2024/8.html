<h2>The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)</h2>
<h3>Making Sense of Qualitative Data Using Interactive Network Visualization: A Case Study of Narratives Concerning Stigma Relating to Substance Use</h3>

<p>Abstract: Qualitative data analysis is a process involving the extraction of meaning from a sample of artifacts. While this process can yield rich insights, there can also be substantial complexity, and a need for greater analytical capabilities than afforded by a given qualitative data analysis tool. In this poster, we present a novel pipeline for qualitative data analysis that facilitates theory-informed investigation of complex psycho-social phenomena. We illustrate the utility of this pipeline using survey data that was collected to elucidate the mechanisms at work in stigma relating to substance use.</p>
