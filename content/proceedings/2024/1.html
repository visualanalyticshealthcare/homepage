<p>Abstract: Pre-medical students face the challenge of managing rigorous academic and extracurricular demands, which can lead to burnout. Effective tracking and visualization of their activities are crucial in keeping records of student progress. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a user-friendly dashboard tailored for pre-medical student data management. Semi-structured interviews with nine MSBP faculty members identified major issues in current data management practices, including standardization and tracking. Using affinity diagramming and Miroboard, five key themes emerged, guiding the creation of an initial dashboard prototype. After iterative critiques and revisions, the final design received positive feedback from the MSBP committee. Limitations include a small sample size and lack of formal usability testing. Future work will focus on addressing implementation challenges and refining the design based on user feedback.</p>
