<p>Abstract: Patient decision aid (PDA) is a tool designed to help individuals make informed choices about their treatment plan in a shared decision-making setting. Multiple treatment options are usually available, and thus the benefits, harms, and practical considerations of each option should be considered before making a decision. These tools can summarize available treatment options for a particular condition, along with their benefits and harms. Several such tools are commonly used in practice such as OptionGrid and Mayo Diabetes cards.However, the timeliness of the information provided by the PDA tools may not always be up-to-date, especially if the evidence base for a particular treatment option is evolving rapidly. The printed decision aids may not be able to keep up with changes in treatment guidelines or recommendations. Additionally, some decision aids can be complex or overwhelming, which may make it difficult for patients to understand and use them effectively. Patients may need additional support or guidance to use decision aids effectively. To address these challenges, we proposed a framework to create a PDA tool based on a living systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) platform using advanced interactive web-based data visualization techniques.</p>
