<h2>The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)</h2>
<h3>Visual Analytics Opportunities and Usability Assessment of a Resident Clinical Competency Assessment Dashboard</h3>
<p>Scott Vennemeyer, Ting Zhang, Christy Li and Danny T.Y Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study assesses the usability of a dashboard designed to assist Clinical Competency Committees (CCCs) in evaluating resident physicians' progress. The dashboard integrates quantitative and qualitative data and offers multiple visualizations to support decision-making. Participants appreciated the integrated data and intuitive layout but identified technical challenges and data limitations, such as delays in data updates and incomplete evaluations. The findings suggest that while the visualizations are effective, addressing technical issues and providing user training could enhance the dashboard's usability. This study highlights the importance of iterative design and user feedback in developing effective visual analytics tools in medical education.</p>
