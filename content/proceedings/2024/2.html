<h2>The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)</h2>
<h3>Developing a Visual Analytics Tool to Explore the Readability Levels of Health-related Documents</h3>

<p>Abstract: For healthcare information to be accessible to a wide range of people, readability assessment is essential. This study aims to develop a visual analytics tool to streamline the readability analysis process. By synthesizing existing research, essentially analytical topics were found, and an R-Shiny application was created. With this application, users can compare readability assessments, examine distributions, enter data, and assess group and overall grade level variations. In addition to being a useful tool for researchers, this standardized approach facilitates efficient communication in healthcare settings. Future work includes formative evaluation and cloud-based deployment.</p>
