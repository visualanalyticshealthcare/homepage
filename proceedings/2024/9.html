<h2>The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)</h2>
<h3>Achieving and Maintaining Euglycemia During Pregnancy for Type 2 Diabetes Through Technology and Coaching: Usability Study</h3>
<p>Athena Stamos, Christine Swoboda, Yiting Wang and Naleef Fareed</p>
<p>Abstract: We conducted usability testing with five patients and eight care team members on a mobile Health application (care team and patients) and dashboard (care team). These digital tools are designed to support Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals who have type 2 diabetes (T2D) to better manage health-related social needs, T2D, and pregnancy. We built prototypes and collected feedback and future recommendations on functionality and user experience. These suggestions will guide future improvements of the digital tools.</p>
