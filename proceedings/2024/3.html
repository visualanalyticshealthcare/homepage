<h2>The 15th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2024)</h2>
<h3>Developing Visual Analytics Capacity of a Clinical Research Project Management System in a Pediatric Heart Institute</h3>
<p>Manhar Suharwardy, Ting Zhang, Aniruddhan Ramesh and Danny T.Y. Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Project management in academic hospitals is crucial for supporting clinical research, however, user adoption of these systems requires high usability and workflow compatibility. This study aimed to grow visual analytics capacity of our CRPMS (created in a past study) to increase the value of data collection on the CRPMS. Munzner's nested model was used to develop visual analytics tools to increase the value of the high amount of data. The CRPMS was implemented in a children's hospital and resulted in increased collaboration, decreased rework, and higher user satisfaction. This methodology provides a framework to improve clinical research management tools, with future work focused on developing an annual review dashboard.</p>
