<h2>The 13th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)</h2>
<h3>Browser-based Infographic Tailoring Self-service Interface (BITSI)</h3>
<p>Adriana Arcia, Daniel Chen, Katherine South</p>
<p>Abstract: Tailored infographics are useful tools for communicating health information to patients and research participants, particularly those with low health literacy, but software is required to automate the tailoring. The Browser-based Infographic Tailoring Self-service Interface (BITSI) is a bespoke software solution for tailoring infographics. BITSI produces batches or single PDFs of tailored infographics in English and Spanish of Asthma Control Test scores at one or two time points using a number line format. This opensource software uses R and a LaTeX compiler; development of a Shiny web application supported a user-friendly, browser-based interface. We improved upon previous infographic tailoring solutions by streamlining installation and creating a user-friendly point-and-click data entry interface. Due to its interface, BITSI is amenable to interfacing with other systems through application programming interfaces, such as with electronic health record systems. These improvements make deployment of tailored infographics in clinical and research settings feasible and practical.</p>
