<p>Abstract: Intensive Care Units (ICUs) regularly generate a high volume of data for their patients. ICU care providers often find interpreting and presenting the voluminous data generated to be timeconsuming during daily care routines. In the same light, a medical ICU at the University of Missouri (MU) Hospital in Columbia, Missouri, employed a visualization dashboard for effective team communication from easily accessible patient data visualization. However, the current dashboard has been underutilized due to many internal and external factors. Therefore, we aimed to redesign the ICU data visualization dashboard called IC-DASH that can overcome the challenges in the existing dashboard and seamlessly integrate it into the workflow of critical care. This paper presents the steps of an in-depth needs analysis implemented to build an ICU data visualization prototype called IC-DASH.</p>
