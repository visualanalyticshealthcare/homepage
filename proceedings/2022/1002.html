<p>Abstract: Athletic Trainers (ATs) are crucial to the process of coordinating care and preventing injuries for student athletes. Despite this, not all high schools have ATs for various reasons. Therefore, it is imperative to examine the impact of ATs. In this mixed methods study, we examine student athleteï¿½s electronic health records (EHRs) and conduct semi-structured interviews to determine the influence of AT presence on the number of Emergency Room visits. To facilitate the statistical analysis of the quantitative data, a R-shiny application was developed utilizing visual analytics. This application allowed the research team to explore with the EHR data through interactive visualization and see statistical comparison results immediately. The R-shiny application is being refined to further explore the data and provide empirical evidence to the qualitative themes.</p>
