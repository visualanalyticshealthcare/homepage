<h2>The 13th Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)</h2>
<h3>Expanding the existing Cadence event visual analysis tool to support the standardized data model OMOP CDM</h3>
<p>Natthawut (Max) Adulyanukosol, David Gotz</p>
<p>Abstract: The differences in health data models obstruct the use of analytics tools on new datasets or at other institutions. This work presents a data conversion tool that converts data from the standardized Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to be compatible with the existing Cadence event visual analysis tool. The tool is available as a web-based application with an interactive data quality report, which makes the data conversion process more observable visually. Users may detect anomalies and unexpected data distributions in the converted data, and solve the issues prior to uploading the data to Cadence. This conversion and visual assessment concept could be applied to other existing analytics tools in healthcare by leveraging the OMOP CDM, and could improve data quality for subsequent analyses.</p>
