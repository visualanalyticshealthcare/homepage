<p>Abstract: Well-being is multi-dimensional and is influenced by many factors that interact together within oneï¿½s environment. This study aimed to develop a web application to consistently collect clinical well-being levels and provide real-time feedback to clinicians and administrators. A Well-being Check app was developed in a user-centered manner with two components: customizable survey and interactive visualization. Once enough data is accumulated, a large-scale analysis will be conducted with connections to the electronic health records to help inform organizational interventions.</p>
